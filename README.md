This is the respository for all the meeting code for the Columbia Creative Coders Club.

You have three options for downloading:

- Download the [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) client and clone from there
- Click the green "Clone or download" button and download as a ZIP

The code in this repo is written using two libraries. Download them to run the code.
